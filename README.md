# How Polarization Has Changed Before and After the 2016 Presidential Election


### Abstract
This project uses adjacency matrices and heat maps to analyze how similarly legislators in the Senate and the House of Representatives vote on bills based on their political affiliation. By comparing the number of agreements and disagreements between Republican-to-Republican, Democrat-to-Democrat, and Republican-to-Democrat party lines, this project visualizes how the Democratic and Republican parties have increasingly diverged in legislative voting patterns since the 2016 Presidential election. This project utilizes data from the 113th, 115th, and 117th sessions, which correspond to 2013-2015, 2017-2019, and 2021-2023, respectively. In the end, we found that polarization did generally increase in the Senate and some parts of the House, but there was also an increase in bipartisan efforts between the 113th and 117th sessions of the House. In addition, intra-party polarization for Democrats in both chambers of Congress consistently decreased over time. The results of this study may have important implications for understanding the current political climate and the ability of legislators to work across party lines.
